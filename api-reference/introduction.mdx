## Welcome

IPBun is a simple, fast, and reliable public IP address API built with Bun, similar to ipify.org. This service provides your public IP address in various formats and supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with optional geolocation data.

## Base URL

```
https://api.ipbun.com
```

## Getting Started

The IPBun API provides several endpoints for retrieving IP addresses:

- **GET /api/v1/ip** - Returns IPv4 address only
- **GET /api/v1/ip6** - Returns IPv6 address only
- **GET /api/v1/ip64** - Returns universal IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)
- **GET /api/v1/health** - Service health check

## Response Formats

All IP endpoints support multiple response formats via the `format` query parameter:

- `text` (default) - Plain text IP address
- `json` - JSON object with IP and optional geolocation data
- `jsonp` - JSONP callback for cross-origin requests

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Check the response headers for rate limit information:

- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - Unix timestamp when the window resets

## Geolocation Data

When requesting JSON format, geolocation data is included when available, containing country, city, coordinates, ISP information, and more.
